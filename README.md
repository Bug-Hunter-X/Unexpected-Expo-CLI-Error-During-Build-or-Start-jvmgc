This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue encountered when using Expo CLI: unexpected errors during the build or start process. The error messages are often unhelpful, making debugging difficult. This example showcases the problem and provides a potential solution involving version checks and dependency management.

**Problem:**

An unexpected error occurs while using Expo CLI to build or start a project.  The error message doesn't clearly indicate the root cause. This is common when dependencies are mismatched or there are incompatibilities between Expo modules or versions.

**Solution:**

The solution often involves carefully checking the versions of all Expo packages and ensuring compatibility. Sometimes cleaning the project's cache or reinstalling dependencies can help.  Always consult the Expo documentation for the latest compatibility information.
